<h2>First things first</h2>
<p>To successfully work through this course, you need to do the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>install a sane editor: Light Table, Vim or Emacs</li>
<li>install Git</li>
<li>install Leiningen</li>
<li>make sure to have a github account</li>
<li>inform the teachers about your github account name</li>
<li>read very carefully the submission instructions</li>
</ul>

<section class="level2" id="editor">
<h2>Editor</h2>
<p>As a lisp, Clojure requires some support from the text editor to be pleasant to write. Luckily a guy named Chris Granger has started a project to create The editor called Light Table. It’s still quite alfa, but works nicely for your purposes during this course. <a href="http://www.lighttable.com/">Check it out</a>. When in doubt, use this.</p>
<p>Light Table is more or less like an ordinary editor with some IDE like features. The thing that sets Light Table apart is the Instarepl. It is a tool in which you can write Clojure code, run it and instantly see the results. This is a great environment to test ideas and also to solve the exercises. Many think that working in the repl is one of the best things in Clojure developement.</p>
<p>When you open Light Table, you get a Welcome screen and menus in the left hand side. To get going, you can open an Instarepl by selecting <code>command</code>, writing <code>open instarepl</code> to the box and selecting the presented choice. This opens a tab to which you can start writing Clojure code.</p>
<p>Not suprisingly, both Vim and Emacs have good plug-ins to work with Clojure. For the basics, one should install the clojure-mode from the Emacs package manager. For a more complete set of tools we can recommend <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit">Emacs Starter Kit</a>. In Vim, <a href="https://github.com/vim-scripts/VimClojure">VimClojure</a> provides you with the necessary goodies.</p>

<h2>Your very own butler</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen">Leiningen</a> is a project management tool for Clojure projects. It handles various tasks related to projects, including building the project, declaring and fetching dependencies, opening an interactive session inside the project, and other such things.</p>
<p>Here’s the instructions for installing Leiningen in Linux:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In your home directory, create a directory called <code>bin</code> if it does not exist all ready.</p>
<pre class="sh"><code>cd ~
mkdir bin</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Add this directory to your $PATH. If you are using Bash, put the following inside the file <code>~/.bashrc</code>. If you are using some other shell, do this where you would normally do these kind of things. If you don’t know what shell you are using, you are using Bash.</p>
<pre class="sh"><code>export PATH=$PATH:~/bin</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Source the <code>~/.bashrc</code> file to apply the changes.</p>
<pre class="sh"><code>source ~/.bashrc</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Download <a href="https://raw.github.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein">this</a> script. Put it in the <code>~/bin</code> directory created in step 1</p></li>
<li><p>Make the script you just downloaded executable.</p>
<pre class="sh"><code>chmod +x ~/bin/lein</code></pre></li>
<li><p>In any directory, issue the command <code>lein help</code>. This will first download the rest of Leiningen. After the download is complete you get a list of services provided by Leiningen.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The table below contains some important Leiningen commands.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: left;">Command</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">midje</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Run all <a href="https://github.com/marick/Midje">Midje</a> tests.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">repl</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Open an interactive Clojure session.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">new</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Create a new Clojure project.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>To get more information about a command, run <code>lein help &lt;command&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The heart of every Leiningen project is the file <code>project.clj</code> at the top level of the projects directroy tree. It contains information about the projects name, version and dependecies among others.</p>
</section>
<section class="level2" id="git">
<h2>Git</h2>
<p><a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a> is an distributed version control system. A fancy name for a tool that keeps track of changes made to files under a directory tree. We use this tool to distribute pre-made Leiningen projects in which you can complete the exercises of every chapter. You also use Git to submit your answers. If you have any problems with Git, ask.</p>
<p>There are three basic commands that you need to know to successfully submit exercises:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git clone</code> will copy a repository</li>
<li><code>git commit -a -m &quot;message goes here&quot;</code> will inform git about all the changes you made. The message should summarise what has changed.</li>
<li><code>git push</code> will upload the changes previously commited to github</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="level2" id="how-to-submit-answers-to-exercises">
<h2>How to submit answers to exercises</h2>
<p>At the start of every chapter, you should go to <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> and <em>fork</em> the chapters repository. There will be a link to the appropriate repository at the beginning of every chapter. You then <em>clone</em> your <strong>own</strong> fork of the repository and start working with the exercises when you encounter them amongs the material. You create <em>commits</em> and maybe <em>push</em> them in to your own fork while working. You also run the tests with <code>lein midje</code> to see if they pass.</p>
<p>When you want your answers graded, you push all of your work with <code>git push</code>. You then go to Github and send a <em>pull request</em>. We will run the tests on our computer and see the code. Your points will be announced on the comment thread of the pull request and the pull request will be closed.</p>
<p>If you didn’t get all the points and want to try again, you are free to do so. Just make modifications to the code, create a commit, push and open a <strong>new</strong> pull request. We once again run the tests and see the code. You will be informed about the <strong>new</strong> points that you got.</p>
<section class="level3" id="tell-us-who-you-are">
<h3>Tell us who you are</h3>
<p>For this system to work, we need to know who you are. Please fill out this form:</p>
<section class="alert alert-error">
<h3>
Watch out!
</h3>

<p>The pull requests are visible to everyone. If you don’t want your grading to be public, create an anonymous Github account and pass the name of that to us.</p>

<h3>Be prepared</h3>
<p>Lets go through the first part of this process to be ready for the next chapter.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Go to the Github page of the repository of the next chapter. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/iloveponies/training-day">link</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the Fork-button near the top-right corner of the page. You will be asked to login if you haven’t done so already.</p></li>
<li><p>The Github page of your fork will open. This is the repository you want to clone. Click the button that says HTTP and copy the link from the box. Then issue the following command with <strong>your</strong> version of the link. Your Github login information will be requested.</p>
<pre class="sh"><code>git clone https://github.com/rapala/training-day.git</code></pre></li>
<li><p>A directory <code>training-day</code> will be created. Go inside the directory and issue <code>lein midje</code>. You should see output that tells you that every test in the project has failed.</p>
<pre><code>cd training-day
lein midje</code></pre>
<p>Instead of <code>lein midje</code>, you can issue the command</p>
<pre><code>lein midje :autotest</code></pre>
<p>This starts a loop which runs the tests again every time you make changes to any of the projects files. A very handy feature, as running plain <code>lein    midje</code> has a pretty long startup time.</p></li>
<li><p>You are now ready to start working with the exercises. When ever you encounter an exercise in the material, open the file <code>src/training_day.clj</code> and fill the appropriate function. Run <code>lein midje</code> often to see if the tests pass.</p></li>
