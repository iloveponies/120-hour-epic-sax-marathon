## Return of the recursion

Often you want to combine elements of a collection, like calculate the sum or
product of a list of numbers, or concatenate a list of strings. That is, we
want to make a transformation like this:

~~~clojure
    (cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 nil)))
;=> (+    1 (+    2 (+    3 0)))
~~~

Or like this:

~~~{.clojure}
    (cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 nil)))
;=> (*    1 (*    2 (*    3 0)))
~~~

<!-- ******* -->

Our tool for this job was recursion:

~~~clojure
(defn sum [a-seq]
  (if (empty? a-seq)
    0
    (+ (first a-seq) (sum (rest a-seq)))))
~~~

To make this more efficient, we made this tail recursive using `recur` and an
accumulator:

~~~clojure
(defn sum [a-seq]
  (let [sum-helper (fn [acc a-seq]
                     (if (empty? a-seq)
                       acc
                       (recur (+ acc (first a-seq))
                              (rest a-seq))))]
    (sum-helper 0 a-seq)))
~~~

This iterative `sum` would evaluate like this:

~~~{.clojure}
;function evaluation                                        accumulator value
(sum              (cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 (cons 4 nil))))) ;
;=> (sum-helper 0 (cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 (cons 4 nil))))) ; 0
;=> (sum-helper 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 (cons 4 nil))))          ; (+ 0 1) => 1
;=> (sum-helper 3 (cons 3 (cons 4 nil)))                   ; (+ 1 2) => 3
;=> (sum-helper 6 (cons 4 nil))                            ; (+ 3 3) => 6
;=> (sum-helper 10 nil)                                    ; (+ 6 4) => 10
;=> 10
~~~

Now let's say that we would like to compute the product of a list of numbers.
It would go like this:

~~~clojure
(defn product [a-seq]
  (let [product-helper (fn [acc a-seq]
                         (if (empty? a-seq)
                           acc
                           (recur (* acc (first a-seq))
                                  (rest a-seq))))]
    (product-helper 1 a-seq)))
~~~

The only two things that changed was the function `+` that was replaced with
`*` and the initial value `0` that was replaced by `1`. So one starts to
wonder if there is a pattern behind this all. And it turns out that there is.
A function called `reduce`.

`(reduce combining-function initial-accumulator-value a-sequence)` takes:

- a function that is used to combine the current accumulator value and the
  current element of the parameter sequence
- an initial value for the accumulator
- a sequence

So what do we get if we re-define our `sum` and `product` with `reduce`?

~~~clojure
(defn sum [a-seq]
  (reduce + 0 a-seq))
(defn product [a-seq]
  (reduce * 1 a-seq))
~~~

Let's see how this `sum` would evaluate:

~~~{.clojure}
(sum            (cons 4 (cons 7 (cons 2 nil))))
;=> (reduce + 0 (cons 4 (cons 7 (cons 2 nil))))
;=> (reduce + (+ 0 4) (cons 7 (cons 2 nil)))    ; accumulator: 0, element: 4
;=> (reduce + 4 (cons 7 (cons 2 nil)))          ; (+ 0 4) => 4
;=> (reduce + (+ 4 7) (cons 2 nil))             ; accumulator: 4, element: 7
;=> (reduce + 11 (cons 2 nil))                  ; (+ 4 7) => 11
;=> (reduce + (+ 11 2) nil)                     ; accumulator: 11, element: 2
;=> (reduce + 13 nil)                           ; (+ 11 2) => 13
;=> 13                                          ; accumulator: 13
~~~

So `reduce` managed to abstract out just the two things that where different
in `sum` and `product`. The initial value and the operation that composes the
values into a one value. Everything else seems to be handled by `reduce`. So
how does it work?

~~~clojure
(defn reduce [f initial a-seq]
  (if (empty? a-seq)
    initial
    (recur f
           (f initial (first a-seq))
           (rest a-seq))))
~~~

Let's go through an evaluation of `reduce`:

~~~clojure
    (reduce + 0                   [1 2 3])
;=> (reduce + (+ 0 1)             [2 3])
;=> (reduce + (+ (+ 0 1) 2)       [3])
;=> (reduce + (+ (+ (+ 0 1) 2) 3) [])
;=> (+ (+ (+ 0 1) 2) 3)
;=> 6
~~~

Time to put the good tool to use.

<exercise>

Write the function `(concat-elements a-seq)` that takes a sequence of
sequences and concatenates them together with `concat`.

Don't use `apply` to implement this function.

~~~clojure
(concat-elements [])            ;=> ()
(concat-elements [[1 2]])       ;=> (1 2)
(concat-elements [[1 2] [3 4]]) ;=> (1 2 3 4)
~~~

</exercise>

## Two Sides of a Coin

One can call `reduce` in two different ways:

~~~{.clojure}
(reduce combinator-function initial-accumulator-value input-sequence)
~~~

or

~~~{.clojure}
(reduce combinator-function                           input-sequence)
~~~

If `input-sequence` is not empty, then the second form works like this:

~~~{.clojure}
    (reduce f (cons elem rest-of-seq))
;=> (reduce f elem rest-of-seq)
~~~

that is, it uses the first element of the parameter sequence as the initial
accumulator value.

And if `input-sequence` is empty, then:

- The first form just returns `initial-accumulator-value`
- The second form returns `(combinator-function)`, that is, it calls
  `combinator-function` with zero parameters.


Let's try this version without initial value:

~~~{.clojure}
(defn seq-min [a-seq]
  (reduce min a-seq))

(seq-min [1])       => 1
(seq-min [5 3 2 6]) => 2
(seq-min [])
  => java.lang.IllegalArgumentException:
     Wrong number of args (0) passed to: core$min (NO_SOURCE_FILE:0)
~~~

Now the call with empty sequence results in an exception, since `min` is not
defined for 0 arguments. Since `seq-min` used `reduce` without an initial
value, it called `(min)` when it was given an empty sequence.

Let's look at an evaluation of a `reduce` call without an initial value.

~~~clojure
(seq-min [5 3 2 6])
;=> (reduce min           [5 3 2 6])
;=> (reduce min 5         [3 2 6]) ; Use the first element as the initial value
;=> (reduce min (min 5 3) [2 6])
;=> (reduce min 3         [2 6])
;=> (reduce min (min 3 2) [6])
;=> (reduce min 2         [6])
;=> (reduce min (min 2 6) [])
;=> (reduce min 2         [])
;=> 2
~~~

<exercise>
Write the function `(str-cat a-seq)` that takes a sequence of strings and
catenates them with one space character between each.

~~~clojure
(str-cat ["I" "am" "Legend"])  ;=> "I am Legend"
(str-cat ["I" "am" "back"])    ;=> "I am back"
(str-cat ["more" " " "space"]) ;=> "more   space"
(str-cat [])                   ;=> ""
~~~

You probably want to handle the special case of empty parameter outside
reduce.
</exercise>

<exercise>
Write the function `(my-interpose x a-seq)` that places `x` between every
element of `a-seq`.

Keep in mind how `conj` works for vectors.

~~~clojure
(my-interpose 0 [1 2 3])               ;=> (1 0 2 0 3)
(my-interpose "," ["I" "me" "myself"]) ;=> ("I" "," "me" "," "myself")
(my-interpose :a [1])                  ;=> (1)
(my-interpose :a [])                   ;=> ()
~~~
</exercise>

Let's look at another example. We implemented the function `count-elem` in
[Recursion], which counts the occurrences of an element in a sequence. Let's
reimplement that function with reduce:

[Recursion]: recursion.html

~~~{.clojure}
(defn count-elem [elem a-seq]
  (let [counter (fn [count e]
                  (if (= e elem)
                    (inc count)
                    count))]
    (reduce counter 0 a-seq)))
~~~

~~~{.clojure}
(count-elem :D [13 "\o/" :D :$ :D [:D] :< "~^._.^~"])
;=> (reduce counter 0                 [13 "\o/" :D :$ :D [:D] :< "~^._.^~"])
;=> (reduce counter (counter 0 13)    ["\o/" :D :$ :D [:D] :< "~^._.^~"])
;=> (reduce counter 0                 ["\o/" :D :$ :D [:D] :< "~^._.^~"])
;=> (reduce counter (counter 0 "\o/") [:D :$ :D [:D] :< "~^._.^~"])
;=> (reduce counter 0                 [:D :$ :D [:D] :< "~^._.^~"])
;=> (reduce counter (counter 0 :D)    [:$ :D [:D] :< "~^._.^~"])
;=> (reduce counter 1                 [:$ :D [:D] :< "~^._.^~"])
;=> (reduce counter (counter 1 :$)    [:D [:D] :< "~^._.^~"])
;=> (reduce counter 1                 [:D [:D] :< "~^._.^~"])
;=> (reduce counter (counter 1 :D)    [[:D] :< "~^._.^~"])
;=> (reduce counter 2                 [[:D] :< "~^._.^~"])
;=> (reduce counter (counter 2 [:D])  [:< "~^._.^~"])
;=> (reduce counter 2                 [:< "~^._.^~"])
;=> (reduce counter (counter 2 :<)    ["~^._.^~"])
;=> (reduce counter 2                 ["~^._.^~"])
;=> (reduce counter (counter 2 "~^._.^~") [])
;=> (reduce counter 2 [])
;=> 2
~~~

<exercise>

Write the function `(my-count a-seq)` that returns the length of a sequence.

Do not use `count` in your implementation.

~~~clojure
(my-count [])      ;=> 0
(my-count [1 2 3]) ;=> 3
(my-count [1])     ;=> 1
~~~

</exercise>

<exercise>

Write the function `(my-reverse a-seq)` that reverses a sequence.

~~~clojure
(my-reverse [1 2 3]) ;=> (3 2 1)
(my-reverse [1 2])   ;=> (2 1)
(my-reverse [])      ;=> ()
~~~

</exercise>

<exercise>

Write the function `(min-max-element a-seq)` that returns the maximal and
minimal elements of `a-seq` in a vertor like `[min max]`.

~~~clojure
(min-max-element [2 7 3 15 4]) ;=> [2 15]
(min-max-element [1 2 3 4])    ;=> [1 4]
(min-max-element [1])          ;=> [1 1]
~~~

</exercise>

<exercise>

Write the function `(insert sorted-seq n)` that adds the number `n` into a
sorted sequence of number. The ordering of the sequence must be preserved.

You don't need to use `reduce` for this, and you probably don't want to.

~~~clojure
(insert [] 2)      ;=> (2)
(insert [1 3 4] 2) ;=> (1 2 3 4)
(insert [1] 2)     ;=> (1 2)
~~~

Now implement `(insertion-sort a-seq)` using `reduce` and the function
`insert`.

~~~clojure
(insertion-sort [2 5 3 1]) ;=> (1 2 3 5)
(insertion-sort [1 2])     ;=> (1 2)
~~~

</exercise>

<exercise>

Write the fuction `(parity a-seq)` that picks into a set those elements of
`a-seq` that occur odd number of time.

~~~clojure
(parity [:a :b :c])    ;=> #{:a :b :c}
(parity [:a :a :b :b]) ;=> #{}
(parity [1 2 3 1])     ;=> #{2 3}
~~~

</exercise>

## Var...argghhhh!

As you may have noticed, some functions in Clojure can take variable amount of
parameters.

~~~clojure
(+ 1 1)       ;=> 2
(+ 1 1 1 1 1) ;=> 5
~~~

Not surprisingly, one can define such functions themselve.

~~~clojure
(defn one-or-two
  ([x] 1)
  ([x y] 2))
~~~

This function has two separate definitions. Each definition is separated from
the others by enclosing it in parentheses. Each of the definitions takes a
different amount of parameters. This is called *arity overloading*. In
English, the right definition is chosen based on how many parameters were
given to the function. This function can be called with one or two parameters.

~~~clojure
(one-or-two :a)  ;=> 1
(one-or-two 5 6) ;=> 2
(one-or-two 1 2 3)
;=> ArityException
;     Wrong number of args (3) passed to: user$one-or-two
;     clojure.lang.AFn.throwArity (AFn.java:437)
~~~

<exercise>

Write the function `minus` that takes one or two parameters.

- If given a one parameter $x$, it returns $-x$.
- If given to parameters $x$ and $y$, it returns $x - y$.

~~~clojure
(minus 2)   ;=> -2
(minus 4 3) ;=> 1
~~~

</exercise>

But what if you don't know the amount of parameters given before hand? Let's
look at a definition of `max`:

~~~clojure
(defn max
  ([x] x)                         ; one parameter
  ([x y] (if (> x y) x y))        ; two parameters
  ([x y & more]                   ; more than two parameters
    (reduce max (max x y) more)))
~~~

First of all, the function has three separate definitions. If we call the
function with one or two parameters, the first and second definitions are
used, respectively.

The third definition of `max` is using *variable arguments*. It means that the
function can be called with any amount of parameters. The first two parameters
are given names `x` and `y` and the rest of the parameters are grouped into a
sequence and given a name `more`. Let's look at an evaluation:

~~~clojure
(max 1 2 3 4)
;=> (reduce max (max 1 2) '(3 4))
;=> (reduce max 2         '(3 4))
;=> (reduce max (max 2 3) '(4))
;=> (reduce max 3         '(4))
;=> (reduce max (max 3 4) '())
;=> (reduce max 4         '())
;=> 4
~~~

<exercise>

Write the function `count-params` that accepts any number of parameters and
returns how many it was called with. You need only a one definition for this.

~~~clojure
(count-params)            ;=> 0
(count-params :a)         ;=> 1
(count-params :a 1 :b :c) ;=> 4
~~~

</exercise>

<exercise>

Write the function `my-*` that takes any number of parameters.

- If no parameters are given, return 1
- If one parameter $x$ is given, return $x$.
- If two parameters $x$ and $y$ are given, return $xy$.
- If more than two parameters $x$, $y$, $\dots$ are given, return their
  product $x \cdot y \cdots$.

You are free to use `*`, but not `apply`.
  
~~~clojure
(my-*)           ;=> 1
(my-* 4 3)       ;=> 12
(my-* 1 2 3 4 5) ;=> 120
~~~

</exercise>

<exercise>

Remember the function `pred-and` that you implemented in
[Predicates](predicates.html)? Write a new definition for it that works for
any amount of parameters.

- If no parameters are given, return a predicate that always returns `true`.
- If only one predicate `p` is given, return `p`.
- If two predicates are given, return a predicate that returns `true` if both
  of them return `true` and `false` otherwise.
- If more than two predicates are given, return a predicate that returns
  `true` only if all of the predicates return `true` and `false` otherwise.

~~~clojure
(filter (pred-and) [1 0 -2])                    ;=> (1 0 -2)
(filter (pred-and pos? odd?) [1 2 -4 0 6 7 -3]) ;=> (1 7)
(filter (pred-and number? integer? pos? even?)
        [1 0 -2 :a 7 "a" 2])                    ;=> (0 2)
~~~

</exercise>

## Encore

The next exercise is a bit trickier.

<exercise>

3 points

Write the function `my-map` that works just like standard `map`. It takes one
or more sequences and a function `f` that takes as many parameters as there
are sequences.

~~~clojure
(my-map inc [1 2 3 4])                  ;=> (2 3 4 5)
(my-map + [1 1 1] [1 1 1] [1 1 1])      ;=> (3 3 3)
(my-map vector [1 2 3] [1 2 3] [1 2 3]) ;=> ((1 1 1) (2 2 2) (3 3 3))
~~~
