## Functions as Parameters

So how do you write a funtion that takes a function as a parameter? Well, for
starters, let's define a function called `(apply-1 f x)` that should return
`(f x)`:

~~~{.clojure}
(defn apply-1 [f x]
  (f x))
~~~

When you take a function as a parameter, you treat it like any other
parameter. In clojure functions are just normal values and you can pass them
around however you like. Calling a function parameter works like calling any
other function.

~~~{.clojure}
(apply-1 str 13) ;=> (str 13) ;=> "13"
~~~

<exercise>
Write the function `(sum-f f g x)` that returns `(+ (f x) (g x))`.

~~~{.clojure}
(sum-f inc dec 4) ;=> 8
(sum-f inc identity 5) ;=> 11
(sum-f identity - 10) ;=> 0
~~~
</exercise>

## Functions as Return Values

A function that returns a boolean value (`false` or `true`) is called a
predicate. Usually their name ends in a question mark `?`. We've already
defined a bunch of them and used them with `filter`.

Let's write a function that returns a predicate. Suppose that I want to get
all numbers greater than some limit from a sequence. I need a predicate for
this grater than testing. Here's a function that returns such predicates.

~~~{.clojure}
(defn greater-than [n]
  (fn [k] (> k n)))
~~~

We've already formed helper functions with `fn`. Since these functions are
just values, we can just return them.

Let's try it out:

~~~{.clojure}
(filter (greater-than 5) [4 6 5 0 9 2 12]) ;=> (6 9 12)
~~~

<exercise>
Write the functions `(less-than n)` and `(equal-to n)` that work like
`greater-than`. Use `==` as comparison in `equal-to`

~~~{.clojure}
(filter (less-than 3) [1 2 3 4 5])   ;=> (1 2)
(filter (less-than 4) [-2 12 3 4 0]) ;=> (-2 3 0)
(filter (equal-to 2) [2 1 3 2.0])    ;=> (2 2.0)
(filter (equal-to 2) [3 4 5 6])      ;=> ()
~~~
</exercise>

### Keywords and Sets as Predicates

When you have a bunch of maps, you often want to filter those that have a
certain `:keyword` as a key. Most of the time, you can just use the `:keyword`
itself as a predicate.

Here are some graphic novels, some of them belong to a series and some are stand
alones.

~~~{.clojure}
(def graphic-novels [{:name "Yotsuba 1" :series "Yotsuba"}
                     {:name "Yotsuba 5" :series "Yotsuba"}
                     {:name "Persepolis"}
                     {:name "That Yellow Bastard" :series "Sin City"}
                     {:name "The Hard Goodbye" :series "Sin City"}
                     {:name "Maus"}
                     {:name "Solanin"}
                     {:name "Monster 3" :series "Monster"}])
~~~

Now it's easy to filter those that belong to a series:

~~~{.clojure}
(filter :series graphic-novels)
;=> ({:name "Yotsuba 1", :series "Yotsuba"}
;    {:name "Yotsuba 5", :series "Yotsuba"}
;    {:name "That Yellow Bastard", :series "Sin City"}
;    {:name "The Hard Goodbye", :series "Sin City"}
;    {:name "Monster 3", :series "Monster"})
~~~

Trouble arises when the value for `:keyword` can be `nil` or `false`. No
worries though, we can write a function that turns any key into a predicate.

~~~{.clojure}
(defn key->predicate [a-key]
  (fn [a-map] (contains? a-map a-key)))
~~~

And these predicates can be used in the same way.

~~~{.clojure}
(filter (key->predicate "Name") [{"Name" "Joe"} {"Blargh" 3}])
;=> ({"Name" "Joe"})
~~~

A similar thing happens when you want to use a set as a predicate. Set's act
as functions and they work like this. `(a-set x)` evaluates to
- `x` if `x` is in `a-set`
- `nil` otherwise

Now you can use a set as a predicate as long as it doesn't contain `false` or
`nil`. You can, for example, use this with `filter` to get all element's in a
sequence that are also elements of a set:

~~~{.clojure}
(filter #{1 2 3} [0 2 4 6]) ;=> (2)
~~~

Trouble arises, as mentioned, if the set happens to have falsey values in it.

~~~{.clojure}
(filter #{1 2 3 nil} [0 2 4 6 nil]) ;=> (2)
~~~

Let's write a function that turns sets into predicates that works correctly
even in this case.

<exercise>
Write the function `(set->predicate a-set)` that takes `a-set` as a parameter
and returns a predicate that takes `x` as a parameter and

  - returns `true` if `x` is in `a-set`
  - otherwise returns `false`

~~~{.clojure}
(filter (set->predicate #{1 2 3})     [0 2 4 6])       ;=> (2)
(filter (set->predicate #{1 2 3 nil}) [2 nil 4 nil 6]) ;=> (2 nil nil)
~~~
</exercise>

## Functions that both Take Functions as Parameters and Return Functions

Sometimes you have a predicate that almost does what you want. For an example,
suppose I want to filter all non-negative values from a sequence. There's
`neg?` and `pos?`, but neither allow `0`. I could do something like this:

~~~{.clojure}
(defn non-negatives [a-seq]
  (let [non-negative? (fn [n] (not (neg? n)))]
    (filter non-negative? a-seq)))

(non-negatives [1 -2 9 4 0 -100 2 0 2]) ;=> (1 9 4 0 2 0 2)
~~~

Wanting to get the opposite result of a predicate is actually common enough
that there's a function for this. It is called `complement`. `(complement
pred)` takes a predicate and returns a new predicate that returns `true`
when `pred` returns a falsey value and `false` when `pred` returns a truthy
value.

~~~{.clojure}
((complement neg?) -5)
;=> (not (neq? -5))
;=> (not true)
;=> false
((complement neg?) 0) ;=> true
((complement neg?) 12) ;=> true
~~~

Now we can write `non-negatives` using `complement`:

~~~{.clojure}
(defn non-negatives [a-seq]
  (filter (complement neg?) a-seq))
~~~

Okay, so `complement` both takes a function as a parameter and returns a new
function. Let's see the definition of `complement`:

~~~{.clojure}
(defn complement [predicate]
  (fn [x] (not (predicate x))))
~~~

Sometimes you have multiple predicates and you want to know whethet a value or
some values pass all of them. Let's create a helper function to do just that.

<exercise>
Write the function `(pred-and pred1 pred2)` that returns a new predicate that:

  - returns `true` if both `pred1` and `pred2` return `true`
  - otherwise returns `false`

Suppose I wanted all even positive numbers from a sequence. With `pred-and`,
this should be easy.

~~~{.clojure}
(filter (pred-and pos? even?) [1 2 -4 0 6 7 -3]) ;=> [2 6]
~~~

Here are some other test cases:

~~~{.clojure}
(filter (pred-and pos? odd?) [1 2 -4 0 6 7 -3]) ;=> [1 7]
(filter (pred-and (complement nil?) empty?) [[] '() nil {} #{}])
;=> [[] '() {} #{}]
~~~
</exercise>

<exercise>
Write the function `(pred-or pred1 pred2)` that takes two predicates and
returns a new predicate that:

  - returns `true` if `pred1` or `pred2` returns true
  - otherwise returns `false`

~~~{.clojure}
(filter (pred-or pos? odd?) [1 2 -4 0 6 7 -3])  ;=> [1 2 6 7 -3]
(filter (pred-or pos? even?) [1 2 -4 0 6 7 -3]) ;=> [1 2 -4 0 6 7]
~~~
</exercise>

## Every

Sometimes you want to know if every element in a sequence satisfies a
predicate. To do that, there's `(every? predicate a-seq)`. It returns `true`
if `predicate` returns a truthy value for every element in `a-seq`. Otherwise
it returns `false`.

~~~{.clojure}
(every? pos? [1 2 3])   ;=> true
(every? pos? [0 1 2 3]) ;=> false -- (pos? 0) ;=> false
~~~

It also always returns `true` with an empty collection.

~~~{.clojure}
(every? pos? [])  ;=> true
(every? pos? nil) ;=> true
~~~

<exercise>
Write the function `(blank? string)` that takes a string as a parameter and
returns `true` if `string` is empty, nil, or contains only whitespace.

Remember that strings can be used as a sequence of characters with
sequence functions like `every?`. A function `whitespace?` that tells
if a character is whitespace is defined for you in the source file.

~~~{.clojure}
(blank? " \t\n\t ") ;=> true
(blank? "  \t a")   ;=> false
(blank? "")         ;=> true
~~~
</exercise>

<info>
You have just implemented a function with the same semantics as
`isWhitespace` in Apache Commons. Here is the [Java implemention]
[isWhitespace] from Apache Commons:

[isWhitespace]: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/commons/proper/lang/trunk/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/lang3/StringUtils.java?view=markup

~~~{.java}
5370	    public static boolean isWhitespace(CharSequence cs) {
5371	        if (cs == null) {
5372	            return false;
5373	        }
5374	        int sz = cs.length();
5375	        for (int i = 0; i < sz; i++) {
5376	            if (Character.isWhitespace(cs.charAt(i)) == false) {
5377	                return false;
5378	            }
5379	        }
5380	        return true;
5381	    }
~~~

This is a good example about how the ability to easily pass around functions
as parameters can improve clarity.

Earlier we had some books, let's add some data to them. Let's keep track of
some awards.

~~~{.clojure}
(def china {:name "China Mi√©ville", :birth-year 1972})
(def octavia {:name "Octavia E. Butler"
              :birth-year 1947
              :death-year 2006})
(def kay {:name "Guy Gavriel Kay" :birth-year 1954})
(def dick {:name "Philip K. Dick", :birth-year 1928, :death-year 1982})
(def zelazny {:name "Roger Zelazny", :birth-year 1937, :death-year 1995})

(def authors #{china, octavia, kay, dick, zelazny})

(def cities {:title "The City and the City" :authors #{china}
             :awards #{:locus, :world-fantasy, :hugo}})
(def wild-seed {:title "Wild Seed", :authors #{octavia}})
(def lord-of-light {:title "Lord of Light", :authors #{zelazny}
                    :awards #{:hugo}})
(def deus-irae {:title "Deus Irae", :authors #{dick, zelazny}})
(def ysabel {:title "Ysabel", :authors #{kay}, :awards #{:world-fantasy}})
(def scanner-darkly {:title "A Scanner Darkly" :authors #{dick}})

(def books #{cities, wild-seed, lord-of-light,
             deus-irae, ysabel, scanner-darkly}])
~~~


<exercise>
Write the function `(has-award? book award)` that returns `true` if `book` has
won `award`.

~~~{.clojure}
(has-award? ysabel :world-fantasy) ;=> true
(has-award? scanner-darkly :hugo)  ;=> false
~~~
</exercise>

<exercise>
Write the function `(HAS-ALL-THE-AWARDS? book awards)` that returns `true` if
`book` has won every award in `awards`.

~~~{.clojure}
(HAS-ALL-THE-AWARDS? cities #{:locus})
;=> true
(HAS-ALL-THE-AWARDS? cities #{:locus :world-fantasy :hugo})
;=> true
(HAS-ALL-THE-AWARDS? cities #{:locus :world-fantasy :hugo :pulitzer})
;=> false
(HAS-ALL-THE-AWARDS? lord-of-light #{:locus :world-fantasy :hugo})
;=> false
(HAS-ALL-THE-AWARDS? lord-of-light #{:hugo})
;=> true
(HAS-ALL-THE-AWARDS? scanner-darkly #{})
;=> true
~~~
</exercise>

## And Then There Were Some

Finally, when you wan't to know if at least one element of a sequence passes a
predicate, there is `(some pred a-seq)` which returns a truthy value if `pred`
returns a truthy value for some element in `a-seq` and otherwise it returns
`nil`.

~~~{.clojure}
(some whitespace? "Kekkonen")          ;=> nil
(some whitespace? "Kekkonen Kekkonen") ;=> True
(some even? [1 2 3])                   ;=> true
(some even? [1 3])                     ;=> false
~~~

Why `some` and not `some?`? Well, `some` is not actually a predicate.
It returns the first truthy value returned by `pred`, and functions
ending in `?` should return strictly `true` or `false`. This is often
useful, but sometimes you need to be careful with it.

~~~{.clojure}
(some first [[] [1 2] []]) ;=> 1
(some first [[] [false true] []] ;=> nil
(some nil? [1 nil 2]) ;=> true
~~~

<exercise>
Write you own implementation for `some` called `my-some`.

Hint: You might find `map`, `filter` and `first` useful (you won't necessarily
need them all).

~~~{.clojure}
(my-some even? [1 3 5 7])       ;=> falsey
(my-some even? [1 3 5 7 8])     ;=> true
(my-some neg? [1 3 5 0 7 8])    ;=> falsey
(my-some neg? [1 3 5 0 7 -1 8]) ;=> true
(my-some neg? [])               ;=> falsey
(my-some first [[false] [1]])   ;=> 1
(my-some first [[false] []])    ;=> falsey
(my-some nil? [1 2])            ;=> falsey
(my-some nil? [1 nil 2])        ;=> true
~~~
</exercise>

<exercise>
Write your own implementation for `every?` called `my-every?`.

Hint: the previous hint applies. `empty?` and `complement` might come in handy
as well.

~~~{.clojure}
(my-every? pos? [1 2 3 4])   ;=> true
(my-every? pos? [1 2 3 4 0]) ;=> false
(my-every? even? [2 4 6])    ;=> true
(my-every? even? [])         ;=> true
~~~
</exercise>

<exercise>
Write the function `(prime? n)` that returns `true` if `n` is a
[prime number] [prime] and otherwise `false`.

[prime]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number

The function `(range k n)` returns the sequence

~~~{.clojure}
(k (+ k 1) (+ k 2) ... (- n 1))
~~~

Here's a concrete example:

~~~{.clojure}
(range 2 10) ;=> (2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)
~~~

A positive integer `p` is a prime number if the only positive numbers dividing
`p` are `p` and `1`.

Your solution should be of the form

~~~{.clojure}
(defn prime? [n]
  (let [pred ...]
    (not (some pred (range 2 n)))))
~~~

Here are some tests:

~~~{.clojure}
(prime? 4) ;=> false
(prime? 7) ;=> true
(prime? 10) ;=> false
(filter prime? (range 2 50)) ;=> (2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47)
~~~
